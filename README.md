This project investigates the adoption and impact of FinTech services in Nepal’s banking sector using primary survey data (110+ responses). The analysis focuses on adoption drivers, user satisfaction, challenges, and the potential for FinTech to reduce physical bank visits.

Tools & Techniques: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels, chi-square tests, logistic regression, econometric modeling.

**Key Contributions:
**
Designed and analyzed a primary survey targeting adoption, satisfaction, and challenges of FinTech services.
Created data visualizations (bar plots, pie charts, heatmaps) to communicate adoption patterns and challenges.
Conducted inferential statistics: Chi-square tests and logistic regression to identify drivers of reduced branch visits.
Addressed statistical modeling challenges such as quasi-separation in logistic regression, ensuring robust and interpretable odds ratios.

**Dataset
**Survey of 110+ respondents across different age groups, cities, occupations, and education levels.

**Questions covered:
**
Demographics (age, location, occupation, education)
FinTech usage frequency and types of services
