Project Overview
This research investigates the structural shift within the Nepalese financial sector caused by the rise of FinTech services. Utilizing primary survey data from 110+ respondents, the study employs econometric modeling and inferential statistics to quantify the drivers of digital migration and its impact on traditional brick-and-mortar banking dependency.

Technical Methodology
Econometric Modeling: Developed a Logistic Regression framework to isolate and identify predictors of reduced physical bank branch visits.

Inferential Statistics: Conducted Chi-Square tests of independence to evaluate the correlation between demographic variables and FinTech adoption rates.

Data Engineering: Implemented robust preprocessing pipelines in Python, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and feature extraction from multi-select survey responses.

Quantitative Visualization: Engineered a comprehensive suite of analytical charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib to communicate adoption patterns and structural barriers.
